      <h2>tl;dr:</h2>
      <p>Thrilled to share our self-titled album, <em>Cheap Sensationalism</em>. The name captures the way the last decade has been vibing.</p>
      <p>This album has been a long time coming. We've been delaying this due to overthinking the nuances of releasing music. We decided to forgo an intricate release process and just get these songs out to some friends and family.</p>
      <p>If the music has anything going for it, it is the variation. These songs span a lot of different phases, each increasing the odds that there is a moment that catches your attention. We'll be adding more soon. For now, we hope you have a listen. Reach out and tell us what you think. Take a risk and share with a friend.</p>
